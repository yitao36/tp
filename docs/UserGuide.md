## Welcome to CCAmper!
CCAmper is the perfect app for **Singaporean secondary school teachers** as an all-in-one desktop app for
- Managing all your various CCA student details plus emergency contact details
- Keeping track of their attendance with respect to various events

CCAmper is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** to help secondary school teachers to
**plan, manage, and simplify** your CCA's weekly tasks faster than traditional **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** apps.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Advanced keyboard technique:** Use `tab` to switch between the input box, person list, and event list!<br>
While focused on the person list or event list, use `up` and `down` to navigate quickly.
</box>

## Quick start

1. Download and install Java `17` or above from this
   <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17">Java downloads page</a>.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed
   [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).<br> {{ verifyJava17Box }}

2. Download our latest CCAmper `.jar` file from our [GitHub page](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.
   <br>We recommend placing the `.jar` file into a folder named `CCAmper` on your desktop for easy access.

4. Open a command terminal, navigate into the folder containing the `.jar` file,
   and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.
<br>{{ navigateGuideBox }}
5. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.
The layout of the application is also shown below. Clicking on a person or event will show more detailed information
about the corresponding item in `DetailedPanel`.

<br>

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

### Prerequisite knowledge

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the syntax and command format:**<br>

* Prefixes start with letters followed by a slash, e.g. `n/`.<br>
  Certain prefixes are reserved for each command, meaning that it is not possible to
  supply a string starting with the reserved prefix to another prefix. Workaround is to use other characters.
  * e.g. `a/FRONT n/MIDDLE BACK` is parsed as two separate prefixes.<br><br>
    
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in **square brackets** are optional.<br>
  * e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
  * e.g `n/NAME [enroll/[YEAR]]` can be used as `n/John enroll/` or as `n/John enroll/2024` or as `n/John`.<br><br>

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be empty, `t/friend`, `t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* For commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`), there should not be any characters (except whitespace) that comes before and/or follow the command keyword. This is to avoid scenarios such as `help list exit`, where command keyed in may be unclear.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Constraints on Person contacts**

| Field                 | Requirements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                  | • Max 50 characters long.<br/>• Letters, numbers, and spaces and the following `.,-'()/` only.<br>• Cannot be blank                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Phone                 | • Encouraged input format: 8-digit Singaporean phone number that starts with one of `3/6/8/9`. <br/> • While it is possible to key in any other inputs such as 90909090 (HP) or +60-12-345 6789, application would issue warnings. This helps to signal a deviation from the encouraged input format (e.g. 90909090 or 9090 9090), allowing users to manually check if the phone number they keyed in is correct. <br/> • While users can key in phone numbers with hyphens and space, these hyphens and space would be removed when phone number is stored in CCAmper.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Email                 | • Max 50 characters long.<br/>• Local-part contains only alphanumeric characters and the following `+_.-`. The local parts may not start or end with any special characters. <br/> • Domain labels are separated by period, consist of only alphanumeric characters and hyphens, <br/>and the end part (after the period) must be at least 2 characters long. <br/>(example.email@do-main.ca) |
| Address               | • Max 70 characters long.<br/>• Any characters, but cannot be blank.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

**Style Guide**

* Additionally, we check user input if they follow the recommended style for the field.<br>
  These do not throw an error, but will display a warning message after the command finishes execution,<br>
  and during launch of the program.

### Successful Commands

Succesful commands should look like such:

<img src="images/successfulCommand.png" height="120" width="800"/>
<br><br>

### Invalid Commands
A warning message will be provided for invalid commands with text providing help on command usage:

<img src="images/invalidCommand.png" height="120" width="800"/>
<br><br>

### Viewing help : `help`

A popup appears which redirects the user to this current page. :D

<img src="images/helpMessage.png" alt="Help Message Window" height="80" width="650"/>
<br><br>

### Adding a person: `add`

Add students to your address book, with the given fields.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [r/ROLE]…​ [t/TAG]… [pin/TRUE] [enroll/YEAR] [ecn/EMERGENCY_NAME] [ecp/EMERGENCY_PHONE]`

Additional information on fields:
* While one may key in phone numbers with hyphen(s) and/or space(s) to improve human-readability, the hyphen(s) and space(s) are automatically removed when phone number is stored in app.
* The emergency contact fields (`ecn` and `ecp`) must be either all provided or not at all.

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 r/President r/Camp leader ecn/Jack Doe ecp/99998888 ece/jackd@example.com enroll/2022 t/friend`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/98765432 t/criminal enroll/2024`

Note: 
* If there are multiple errors when keying in the add command (e.g. duplicate fields, missing compulsory fields, some fields do not follow the correct format), CCAmper may show error messages in batches, rather than all at once, and only show the next batch of error messages once the current batch of error messages is resolved. This is to help users avoid information overload.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the displayed person list.
* `find n/Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: I would like to report a bug / give feedback for the product. Where can I do so?<br>
**A**: Please raise an issue on our <a href="https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/issues">GitHub</a> page.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
